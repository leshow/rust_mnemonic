I'll be using the great rust-crypto ( https://github.com/DaGenix/rust-crypto )
for all of the crypto implementations necessary to get this tool to work.


My goal is to have a small cmdline app like python-mnemonic but written in
rust.

I've only just started learning rust so it may be some time before this is usable.
